# Variablen

Variables are placeholders who usually contain a dynamic value. A variable has to be defined in a certain notation and
will be resolved to their actual value when using it.

That notation can differ, depending on which bot you're using (StreamLabs, StreamElements or Nightbot). For instance,
the username of the user that executed a command can be determined via the `{user.name}`
variable in StreamLabs, with the variable `${user.name}` when using StreamElements or by using the `$(user)` variable in
Nightbot.
